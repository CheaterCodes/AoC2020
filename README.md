# AoC2020
Advent of Code 2020

## Day 1
Task: Given a list of numbers, find two (for part two three) numbers thast add up to 2020 ad return their product.

Quite a simple Task.
Since the list of numbers is decently small I took the lazy approach and just did two (or three) nested for loops.
Works fine, not very optimal.
Wow, Day 1 and I'm alreay lazy :D
